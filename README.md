# Customers Component

The `Customers` component is used for displaying a list of customers and their details. It integrates a DataGrid from Material UI to display customer information such as name, email, phone number, and address. The component also supports searching for customers by name and includes a sidebar with a drawer for navigation.

## Features

- **Drawer Sidebar**: A slide-out drawer is implemented using the `DrawerComponent`. It can be toggled on and off.
- **Search Bar**: A search bar at the top allows users to search for customers by name, fetching specific customer data from the backend.
- **Customer Data Table**: Displays customer data in a paginated table with options for sorting and checkbox selection.
- **Pagination**: Allows users to paginate through customer records, with the ability to change the number of records displayed per page.

## Structure

1. **Drawer Sidebar**:
   - The `DrawerComponent` renders a slide-out sidebar for navigation, which can be toggled via a button in the header.

2. **Search Bar**:
   - The `SearchBar` component allows users to search for customers by name. The `name` parameter is fetched from the route parameters (`useParams` from `react-router-dom`), which is used to filter customers.

3. **Customer Data Table**:
   - The `DataGrid` component from Material UI is used to display customer data in a tabular format. The data includes fields such as customer ID, name, email, phone, and address.
   - Pagination is supported, and users can select the number of rows per page.

4. **State Management**:
   - The component uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing the state of customers and updating the data when the search parameter changes.

5. **API Integration**:
   - The component fetches customer data from an external API (`localhost:3000/customers`) using Axios. If a name parameter is present, it fetches specific customer data filtered by name.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/onesmuskipchumba0/AdminDashboard.git
cd AdminDashboard/frontend
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the application:
```bash
npm start
```

- **axios**: A promise-based HTTP client used for making API requests.
- **react-router-dom**: Used for routing and handling the `name` parameter in the URL.
- **react**: The core library for building the UI.

## How It Works

1. **Drawer Sidebar**: The sidebar can be toggled open and closed using the `toggleDrawer` function, providing easy navigation options.
2. **Search Bar**: Users can enter a customer name into the search bar, which triggers a request to the backend to fetch the relevant customer data based on the entered name.
3. **DataGrid**: The `DataGrid` component is used to display a list of customers. Each customer has information such as ID, name, email, phone, and address. The table supports pagination and checkbox selection.
4. **Fetching Customer Data**: On initial load, the `fetchCustomers` function fetches all customer data. If a `name` parameter is passed in the URL, the data is filtered to return customers that match the given name.

     - **Pie Chart**: Visualizes proportional data.
     - **Sales Chart**: Shows overall sales data.
     - **Sales Line Chart**: Depicts sales data over time, typically for trend analysis.

4. **State Management**:
   - The component uses Reactâ€™s `useState` hook to manage the open state of the drawer (`open`).

5. **API Integration**:
   - While this component doesn't include specific API calls, it is designed to work with data-driven components like charts that would likely fetch their data from an API endpoint.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
